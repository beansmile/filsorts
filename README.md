# Filsorts

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/filsorts`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'filsorts'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install filsorts

## Usage

1. select column to filter

```
filsorts_params(::User)

# the same as
# params do
#  optional :q, type: Hash do
#    optional :column_name, type: column_type
#    ... all column
#  end
#  optional :sort_column, type: String, values: ["#{column} ASC", "#{column} DESC"]
#  ... all sort
# end

# or select column
filsorts_params(::User, filters: [:name, :phone]) # select name and phone column
# or select column by specific predicate
filsorts_params(::User, filters: { name: :eq, phone: :cont }) # select name and phone column by predicate
```

2. filter collection

```
filsorts(collection)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
